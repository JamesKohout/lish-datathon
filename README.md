Competition rules:

>Our datathon is split across two tracks, each with slightly different rules and with different contest rankings and winners. Your team has been randomly assigned to Track Lagrange, which has the rules listed below. Note that prizes will be awarded within your track, so everyone that you are competing against faces the same rules.
>
>Contest Timeline. You have until 5PM EST on Sunday, February 13th, 2022 to work on the problem. After that time, our kaggle submission website will not accept new predictions. You can see the contest timeline and remaining time in the contest on our datathon website.
>Do All of Your Work in This Notebook. All work you do on the competition must be done within this notebook - you may not use your own integrated development environment (IDE). This includes any exploration of the data or problem space that you conduct before arriving at a final model. You may not copy code or any other information from other sources.
>No External Help. Do not discuss the details of the competition, prediction problem, or data set with anyone else (including other contest participants). All work should be your own (or your competition partner's).
>You may freely consult textbooks, documentation, and websites such as stack-overflow.
>
>No Additional Data Sets. Do not use any additional data sets not already provided in this notebook. You may create new features based on existing features in the provided data.
>We will collect contest code at the end of the competition in order to verify rule compliance - if your code breaks any of the rules, then you will excluded from consideration for contest prizes.

One stream (which we were on) had no restrictions, while the other restricted the use of standard implementations of ML algorithms. 

About the task:

>Access to potable water is vital to the health and wellbeing of communities around the world. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available everywhere.  In this competition, you will develop a predictive model that solve binary classification task focused on predicting the operational status of water pumps throughout Tanzania, based on some the provided information about their installation context. 
>
>We will evaluate prediction quality according to a [Log-Loss Error Function](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/what-is-log-loss). (Note that this is different than Percent Accuracy!) As you know, a good statistical model is paramount for helping organizations allocate maintenance resources effectively. Weâ€™ve sourced this problem from our friends at [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/), who are some awesome alumni of Harvard Business School and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
